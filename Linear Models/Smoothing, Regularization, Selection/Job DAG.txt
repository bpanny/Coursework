1a. Component plus residual plot
Add lowess and mSpline smoothers from topic 7 live example

1b. Choose best model from fractional polynomial output
Show component plus residual plot
include fractional polynomial and mspline with df=4

1c. Choose best model from graphs from 1a and 1b

2a. Use R code chunk to alter DA3 column names. Fit given model and assess descriptive adequacy of sales price.

2b. Fit model with local taxes as predictor. Asses agreement the best predictor of sales price is local taxes?

2c. Are other physical building characteristics redundant when local taxes are included in the model? Fit with all 9 predictors. Assess collinearity and assess what I see. Should I fit another model for this part? If so I fit and assess suggestion.

2d. Choose best model from 2a through 2c

2e. Fit LASSO, elasticnet, and backwards selection. What is most adequate model or set of models to predicts sales price? Don't perform model diagnostics, tho typically would.

NOTE: data set too small for model validation in this exercise.
