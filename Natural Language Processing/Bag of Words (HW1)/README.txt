hw1_skeleton_part2_bmp83.ipynb contains my code for part 2

how to run your code

I used jupyter notebooks in VSCode on Windows 11 with Python 3.11.5. I think my only extra import was scipy.sparse.lil_matrix/pandas/numpy

I should add that the term_content_matrix code takes forever to run (the code really sucks). I improved upon this code in part 2 but don't have time to comb over these improvements to integrate with part 1. The code in part 2 for term_context and ppmi runs much faster! Code runtime for term-document and tf_idf in part 1 is relatively tolerable.

any additional resources, references, or web pages youâ€™ve consulted

I used a mix of python documentation (numpy, scipy, base), stackoverflow, and chatGPT to learn and iteratively improve the ways I wanted my code to be written to carry out the necessary NLP procedures. This is because I can find myself knowing what logic I want to carry out, but needing to research how it can be written if I haven't memorized the necessary tools yet. If I learned something new, I would test it out on simple examples before integrating it into the larger workflow.
