Welcome,

The Machine Learning folder contains structured HWs and a Final Project that involves building Bayesian and non-Bayesian linear and generalized linear models for regression and classification for a real-world application (optimizing surface coating for PPG Industries). It also includes some non-linear methods (neural networks, random forests, and gradient-boosted trees) as well as Exploratory Data Analysis/Visualization. The files are split up into  EDA, Classification, Regression, Interpretation/Optimization. Reports are HTML files.

The Health Data Science folder contains a project I completed in Fall of 2021 using public datasets from ourworldindata.org. It involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis/visualization in R to examine international relationships between life expectancy and extreme poverty.

The Plotting for Scientific Publication folder includes an R script for plotting fMRI region-of-interest analysis results for scientific publication. It includes a .tiff file of the figure produced by the script.

The Intro to Statistical Methods folder contains structured HWs and Projects in R. These Rmd files are mostly to do with summarizing data and performing hypothesis tests.
