The Machine Learning folder contains structured HWs and a Final Project that involves building many machine learning models for regression and classification on a real-world application (optimizing surface coating for PPG Industries). It also involves Exploratory Data Analysis.

The Health Data Science folder contains a project I completed in Fall of 2021 using public datasets from ourworldindata.org. It involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis/visualization in R

The Intro to Statistical Methods folder contains structured HWs and Projects in R
