Welcome,

The Machine Learning folder contains structured HWs and a Final Project that involves building Bayesian and non-Bayesian machine learning models for regression and classification for a real-world application (optimizing surface coating for PPG Industries). It also involves Exploratory Data Analysis. The Project_Full.html and Project_Full.rmd files contain the latest draft of the project.

The Health Data Science folder contains a project I completed in Fall of 2021 using public datasets from ourworldindata.org. It involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis/visualization in R to examine international relationships between life expectancy and extreme poverty.

The Intro to Statistical Methods folder contains structured HWs and Projects in R. These files are mostly to do with summarizing data and performing hypothesis tests.
